# Code-Challenge-mid-level-Backend

The `defect.js` contains logic on how to report a defect of a machine, which is reported by a worker.

This structure is based on a monolithic function. The task is to refactor that function: 

1. Refactor the code based on clean code standards
2. Propose and describe how you would implement a design pattern (e.g. controller, service etc.)

Note: The example-db.sql is just a snippet of the database and should support the understanding of the logic. The function does not need to be executed. The motivation of this challenge is to understand your refactored code. 

Timeframe: Please just take maximal 3 to 4 hours. 

Please send your result as a .zip folder to diana.rees@zerowork.io
